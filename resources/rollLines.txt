Are you feeling lucky?
More doom to the DM!
Enjoy!
Here's some help!
Are you sure this is a good idea?
This is the moment of truth!
Doom for the Game Master!
Calculating your inevitable failure...
Would you like to spend some plot points on that roll?
Tides of Fortune to the rescue!
Let's hope this isn't a Sorcery roll.
Impending doom approaches...
I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took a doom point to the roll.
Co-operation is always still an option.
The Licians will tell stories of your failure for years to come.
It'll work out in the long run...right?
Did you really study gamecraft as a young Boheim?
True Curiosity doesn't necessarily have to mean 'True Stupidity'.
Let's hope the Holichasma user has Primal mana left.
Can you use Second Guessing to second guess this roll itself?
Let's hope the Daughter of Spring's interest in education also includes probabilities.
Yep, you're dead.
I believe you can do it...I just suggest you spend some more plot points.
This roll is a challenge made by the Tester.
This one is going in the Atrocity Archive.
I mean...I guess failing horribly will also make you stand out.
I'm just hoping this isn't to convince a Hearthblood.
Can't you use Reality Marble on this roll?
I hope you have the Withstand Blowback expert application.
Ouch, that's going to hurt.
I believe in you! I just don't believe in this roll.
I'll ask OneDee if he could roll a bit higher...
The Game Master will love you for the doom.
Quick, ask Lance to rig OneDee for you before the GM notices!
And that was how the party died.
The vampires are after you now!
You might need some retraining after your skills got taken.
